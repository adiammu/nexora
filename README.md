Project Description
A budget tracker project is a tool designed to help users monitor and manage their finances effectively. It allows users to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, and track spending trends over time, enabling better financial planning and control.

The Problem statement
The ridiculous problem a budget tracker solves is the mystery of "where did all my money go?" It tackles the chaos of forgotten subscriptions, impulse buys, and untracked expenses, ensuring your finances donâ€™t feel like a black hole of confusion.

The Solution
mystery with a sleek web app that acts like your personal finance detective. It tracks every dollar, categorizes your spending, and even gives you insights so you can finally crack the case of the disappearing paycheckâ€”no magnifying glass needed!
